          "description": "Added: support an experimental template for YouTube feed ðŸ“º Demo | Source\n\nAggregate content from any YouTube channel rss url https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=<replace_with_channel_id>\nVideos are embedded via iframe and loading accelerated by youtube-lite-embed\nAds are reduced thanks to YouTube's policy for embedded videos ðŸ™ƒ\nWorks on mobile devices with butter smooth horizontal scroll.\nCaveat: the template works only with YouTube content. You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",
